<p align="center"><em>SCADA that doesn't suck.</em></p>
<p align="center">Your data. Your control. Anywhere.</p>



**Scadable** is a next-generation **SCADA-as-a-Service** platform built for the modern industrial world. We deliver powerful monitoring and control capabilities through a cloud-native, API-first model, eliminating the complexity and cost of traditional on-premises systems.

Our mission is to empower developers and operators to innovate without the burden of infrastructure.



## ❌ The Problem with Traditional SCADA

Legacy SCADA systems are holding businesses back. They are typically:

* **Monolithic & Inflexible:** Locked into proprietary, on-premise hardware that is difficult to scale or customize.
* **Expensive:** Burdened by high upfront licensing costs, per-tag fees, and constant maintenance.
* **Slow & Complex:** Require specialized OT expertise, slowing down integration and innovation.
* **Siloed:** Keep critical data trapped, preventing access for modern analytics and custom applications.



## ✅ Why Scadable is Different

Scadable breaks down these barriers with a flexible, developer-centric approach.

| Feature                          | Benefit                                                                                               |
| :------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Cloud-Native & API-First** | Build custom workflows and integrate with any tool. No vendor lock-in.                                |
| **Guaranteed 24/7 Uptime** | Our multi-region architecture ensures your operations are always online, without you managing servers.  |
| **Dynamic Scaling** | Resources scale automatically to meet demand, ensuring smooth performance from one device to thousands. |
| **Pay-As-You-Go Pricing** | Transparent, consumption-based pricing. No surprise per-tag fees or expensive upfront licenses.        |
| **Programmable Pipelines** | Automate complex sequences—like data collection, analysis, and control commands—with simple API calls. |
| **Decoupled Architecture** | Your business logic stays in your application, not locked in the SCADA. This means lower latency and simpler upgrades. |



## 🏗️ How It Works: System Architecture

Our platform is designed to be a flexible service layer that connects to your devices and empowers your applications.
