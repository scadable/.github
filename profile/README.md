<p align="center"><em>SCADA that doesn't suck.</em></p>
<p align="center">Your data. Your control. Anywhere.</p>



**Scadable** is a next-generation **SCADA-as-a-Service** platform built for the modern industrial world. We deliver powerful monitoring and control capabilities through a cloud-native, API-first model, eliminating the complexity and cost of traditional on-premises systems.

Our mission is to empower developers and operators to innovate without the burden of infrastructure.



## ‚ùå The Problem with Traditional SCADA

Legacy SCADA systems are holding businesses back. They are typically:

* **Monolithic & Inflexible:** Locked into proprietary, on-premise hardware that is difficult to scale or customize.
* **Expensive:** Burdened by high upfront licensing costs, per-tag fees, and constant maintenance.
* **Slow & Complex:** Require specialized OT expertise, slowing down integration and innovation.
* **Siloed:** Keep critical data trapped, preventing access for modern analytics and custom applications.



## ‚úÖ Why Scadable is Different

Scadable breaks down these barriers with a flexible, developer-centric approach.
